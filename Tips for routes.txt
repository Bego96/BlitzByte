Maybe we can achieve this by each product having its own link route in array of products, so we can render trought map multiple
routes in Routes components in Main, therefore, we would use that route link in each product item component and set it with Link to.

Our current routing works but its not set immediately so unfortunately if we try to reach individual product link we get an error
unless we already have that route link set.
