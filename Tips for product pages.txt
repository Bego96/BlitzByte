Tips for product pages:
When user clicks on a product wether its on a slider or a list, he gets redirected to new page. That new page is a single page where 
data gets passed from a click on a particular product, when user clicks all data gets sent from that product to that page it technicaly sets aka binds data in that page.
React router is used for pages. So when user clicks on a product, that products data gets sent over to that page where it gets all information and data bind in html. 

1.User clicks on a product, function fires that checks product with corresponding id and takes those data's as prop's that gets passed to the page.
2.Function should lay in parent component that works as a service for data sharing. In our case Main component is the parent component.
