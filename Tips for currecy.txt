Tips for currencies:
1. When data is pulled from database, when components render we want to check which currency has been selected or set as default values
for select option in navigation, 
2. we do that with conditional statements that run each time component/'s render or re-render if necessary, 
3. so first time render it checks the default value for selected currency in navigation, conditional statements checks wether its EUR or BAM etc.. 
4.then it runs setCurrency state to update it to selected value, then we do go trought whole array of imported data from database and calculate all the prices 
with formula to exchange current currency with selected one. 
5. It should be done with useEffect considering data is fetched from back end. Thanks to for loop we can loop trought array of data and change currencies 
with formula.
